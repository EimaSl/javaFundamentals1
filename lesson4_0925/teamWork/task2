Create class ComputerService which would have methods such as

void connectToInternet();
void sendEmail(String emailBody, String recipient); Bonus: add validation to check if message is not too long. (Tip. use .length() method on string, to get the length of it and validate)
void multiplyTwoNumbers(double numberOne, double numberTwo);
void modifyUser(User user) -> this method should update current User data (yes you need to create User object first with some data, then pass it to this method to update the data)

You can also update the sendEmail method by passing User object instead of String recipient, where User object will have a field

BONUS create a method with return type as String and return quote of the day, based on passed parameter

eg. (just do something similar)

public String getQuoteOfTheDay(int number) {
    if (number == 1) {
      return "Today is nice!";
    } else if (number == 2) {
      return "Today is very very very nice";
    } else {
      return "No quotes for today";
}
