+ Create Father class and Box class.

+ Father class must have some fields, to describe how the created object will look like. Eg. Class Father.
He can have name, age, powerLevel, cashAmount. (use for validation for pocketMoney. Maybe child asks too much?)

The class must have methods such as

Void tellAJoke(String typeOfJoke) -> based of type of joke, use if/else to tell different joke.
Eg. lightJoke -> tell easy joke, mediumJoke -> tell another.
Another example -> tellAStory(String storyType) , story can be sad, fun or whatever.

Void method carryBoxToTheBuilding (eg. Carry a Box to 5th floor) Parameters would be Box box, int floorNumber.

Validate if Father can carry the box. if it is not too heavy.

Method which return type is double with one parameter (eg. givePocketMoney).

Ask father for some money to give plus he can add some extra. Use validation with cash.

Method which return type is int with three parameters (eg. Add three numbers). Eg. Help with math task :)
Methods which have return type, result of the method should be stored in the variable in Main class and printed out separately.
